# MNIST-modeling
MNIST is a set of images of hand written digits paired with the actual digit in the image.  
my goal is to use this data to train our model and be able to read the hand written digit in images.
I used a Guassian model to fit the data, and normalized the data using a constant. The constant is found using cross validation.
After training the data, the model is used on a test set and the error rate was around 4%.
